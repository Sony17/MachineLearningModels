# MachineLearningModels
It's the repository of different machine learning models. It will have basic machine learning models template coded in python using google colab.

Machine Learning Regression models:
Regression model can be linear and non linear can be used to predict real value.It has dependent and independed variables. 
If the independednt varialble is time , we are predicting future values . we can also predict unknown values with the regression models.

1.Simple Linear Regression
y= b0 + c*x1

Ordinary Least square:
BestFitting Line
Sum(y -y')2 -->min


2.Multiple Linear Regression
3.Polynomial Regression
4.Support Vector for Regression (SVR)
5.Decision Tree Classification
6.Random Forest Classification
